### Testing Strategy for Task 3 (Boundary Value Analysis)

I will thoroughly test the behavior of the iOS application's password-change functionality, using Boundary Value Analysis (BVA). My goal is to carefully validate boundary points and conditions around password complexity and functionality. Specifically, I will test scenarios around:

- Validating 'Save' button disabled when both "new" and "current" password fields are empty.
- Validating 'Save' button disabled when only 'current password' is entered (new password missing).
- Validating 'Save' button disabled when only 'new password' is entered (current password missing).
- Validating hide/show 'new password' icon state:
  - Disabled when the field is empty.
  - Enabled when at least 1 character is present.
- Validating hide/show 'current password' icon state:
  - Disabled when 'current password' field is empty.
  - Enabled when 'current password' field has text (at least 1 char).
- Validating hide/show icon functionality for both 'new' and 'current' passwords.
- Validating password assertions for 'Min. 8 characters', 'At least 1 letter', and 'At least 1 number':
  - Assertions inactive/active based on password content.
- Validating the 'Save' button state based on the status of password criteria assertions.
- Validating clear and correct error message when 'current password' is incorrect.
- Validating success message and navigation behavior on successful password update.

  - Expected: Icon enabled state.
  - Verification: Confirm visually.

- **Test Case 5:** Hide/Show functionality for 'new password'
  - Step: Toggle the icon.
  - Expected: Password visibility toggles appropriately.
  - Verification: Confirm visually.

- **Test Case 6:** Hide/Show functionality for 'current password'
  - Step: Toggle the icon.

  - Verification: Confirm visually.

**Scenario: Password Criteria Assertions**

- **Test Case 7:** Less than 8 characters
  - Expected: 'Min. 8 characters' assertion inactive.
  - Verification: Confirm visually.

- **Test Case 7:** Exactly 8 characters or more
  - Expected: 'Min. 8 characters' assertion active.
  - Verification: Confirm visually.

- **Test Case 8:** No letters included
  - Expected: 'At least 1 letter' assertion inactive.
  - Verification: Confirm visually.

- **Test Case 8:** At least 1 letter included
  - Expected: 'At least 1 letter' assertion active.
  - Verification: Confirm visually.

- **Test Case 9:** No numeric characters
  - Expected: 'At least 1 number' assertion inactive.
  - Verification: Confirm visually.

- **Test Case 10:** At least one numeric character included
  - Expected: 'At least 1 number' assertion active.
  - Verification: Confirm visually.

**Scenario: 'Save' Button Enabling/Disabling Based on Assertions**

- **Test Case 11:** All criteria met
  - Step: Both passwords provided correctly, assertions active.
  - Expected: 'Save' button enabled.
  - Verification: Confirm visually.

- **Test Case 12:** Reduce new password length below 8 characters after enabling CTA
  - Expected: 'Save' button becomes disabled, assertion inactive.
  - Verification: Confirm visually.

- **Test Case 13:** Remove letters from new password after enabling CTA
  - Expected: 'Save' button disabled, letter assertion inactive.
  - Verification: Confirm visually.

- **Test Case 14:** Remove numbers from new password after enabling CTA
  - Expected: 'Save' button becomes disabled, numeric assertion inactive.
  - Verification: Confirm visually.

**Scenario: Error and Success Messages**

- **Test Case 14:** Incorrect current password entered
  - Step: Press 'Save' with incorrect current password.
  - Expected: Clear error message indicating incorrect password.
  - Verification: Confirm visually.

- **Test Case 15:** Correct current password entered
  - Step: Press 'Save' with correct current and new passwords.
  - Expected: Clear success message displayed.
  - Verification: Confirm visually.

- **Test Case 15:** Successful password update navigation validation
  - Expected: User navigated to settings page after successful update.
  - Verification: Confirm navigation visually.
